## Master coding skills

#### This is a repository where I keep my practicing with small exercises of coding, in order to face technical interviews.

#### They will be solved in JavaScript but most of them I will also use PHP just to improve my skills in this language.

Inspired in Udemy course: Máster en pruebas técnicas de Víctor Robles.
